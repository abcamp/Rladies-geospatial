Laboratory in conjunction with the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture,
2021. Updated February 2022.The 2020 Update to the Hawaiʻi Statewide Agricultural Land Use Baseline layer was created to provide a snapshot of contemporary commercial agricultural land use activity in Hawaiʻi. It is based upon an assemblage of geospatial datasets, primarily high-resolution WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellite imagery (2018 – 2020) used as a base layer for digitization. Additional datasets used in this work include GIS layers provided by the state of Hawaiʻi, Office of Planning Statewide GIS Program and other data provided by major land owners and managers. County Real Property Tax and Agricultural Water Use data were also used to identify commercial farm operations. Not all properties that receive County agricultural tax assessment rates or reduced water cost for agricultural uses were mapped due to the small scale of some of their operations. These data sources were used to verify mapped commercial farms and identify operations that might have been missed using the imagery alone.  Digitized crop locations and boundaries were verified through a combination of on-the-ground site visits, meetings and presentations of draft layers with agricultural stakeholders and landowners, solicitations through a publicly accessible online web mapping portal, and spot- checking using Google Earth™ and other high resolution imagery sources. The 2020 Update to the Hawaiʻi Statewide Agricultural Land Use Baseline layer represents our best efforts to capture the scale and diversity of commercial agricultural activity in Hawaiʻi in 2020 and should be used for informational purposes only. Note: February 2022:  Maui County added, Several additional minor 
updates have been made to the original 2020 Update to the Hawaii 
Statewide Agricultural Land Use Baseline that was published in May 2021. Note: April 2022: Several users of the data discovered that the original
 2015 Hawaiʻi Statewide Agricultural Land Use Baseline layer and the 
2020 Update to the Hawaiʻi Statewide Agricultural Land Use Baseline 
layer did not overlay properly, with an offset between the layers of 10 
feet to 40 feet, depending on the area. As a result, both the original 
and the updated layers have been republished, and now overlay as they 
should. The underlying data itself has not changed. Please note - if you
 download data from the State's geoportal 
(https://geoportal.hawaii.gov/), the data is exported in WGS84 
coordinates, although it is stored internally (in the State’s 
geodatabase), served in the State's web services 
(https://geodata.hawaii.gov/arcgis/rest/services) and made available in 
the State's legacy download site 
(https://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data-expanded/) in UTM / 
NAD 83 HARN coordinates.
